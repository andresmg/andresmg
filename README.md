Passionate developer with more than 10 years of experience in UX / UI, responsible, proactive, attentive to details, with good learning ability and I adapt to any situation. Love challenges, and that is why I joined Ironhack (where I has being selected among the 3 best final projects and won the final axe), to learn new technologies as a full stack developer and above all to continue growing and enjoying what I do.
